 * <p>
 * You pass the function a reference to the context to reserve in the

 * at this point. To enable your context, call DSpContext_SetState (page 2-43).
 * The context will show up on the display once the context has been placed in
 * the active state.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The attributes structure you can specify in the DSpContextAttributesPtr
 * parameter provides the configuration information for the display when it
 * is in the active or paused states. If you would like to override the
 * attributes of the context, you may do so in the attributes structure. For
 * example, if you ask for a 320x240x16 display but the closest match is a
 * context that is 640x480x32, passing in your requested attributes when you
 * reserve the context will cause the DSpContext_GetBackBuffer function to
 * return a graphics pointer that refers to a 320x240x16 drawing environment.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Along the same lines, you should turn off features that you are not
 * interested in when you reserve the context. For example, if the context
 * supports page flipping (and you know this because you requested the
 * actual capabilities of the context using DSpContext_GetAttributes), you
 * can turn off the page-flipping bit in your desired attributes so that you
 * will be assured of using software buffering.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You should only specify a back buffer bit depth different from the
 * display bit depth when you absolutely must, as it is the worst case
 * scenario for DrawSprocket and will result in a synchronous call to
 * CopyBits to bring your back buffer to the display.

 * valid values for the inPlayState parameter. In summary, you can make
 * these choices:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * A context's initial play state is inactive. When all contexts for a
 * display are set to kDSpContextState_Inactive, the display looks exactly
 * as it does when the user is using their Macintosh normally: the monitor
 * resolutions are set to the default, the menu bar is available, and so on.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Set the play state to kDSpContextState_Active to use the display. In this
 * state, the attributes of the context are used to change the display
 * resolution, remove the menu bar, and so on. When at least one context is
 * active, all the display devices in the system are covered by a blanking
 * window. When a context is in the active state, the display is completely
 * owned by the game.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Set the play state to kDSpContextState_Paused to temporarily restore
 * system adornments, while maintaining the attributes used by the context.
 * This gives the user the opportunity to use the menus and switch to other
 * applications. While the context is in the paused state, it is very
 * important to call DSpProcessEvent to allow DrawSprocket to correctly
 * handle events such as suspend or resume (see the DSpProcessEvent function
 * on (page 2-72). Page flipping and double buffering are inactive in this
 * state, and the context will be placed back at page 0 if page flipping was
 * being used.
